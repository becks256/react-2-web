# react-2-web

Welcome to `react-2-web` â€“ a library designed to seamlessly transform React components into Web Components. This project enables you to expose your existing React components as Web Components, making them easily consumable in any environment, including frameworks like Angular, Vue, and even in plain static HTML web pages.

## Features

- **React in Web Components**: Embed your React components inside Web Components, combining the power of React with the wide compatibility of Web Components.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use the transformed components in any JavaScript framework or even without any framework at all.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing projects without heavy modifications.
- **Isolation and Encapsulation**: Leverage the Shadow DOM's style and behavior encapsulation to keep your components isolated and consistent across different environments.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-2-web
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-2-web
```

## Usage

### Converting a React Component to a Web Component

1. **Import the library**:

2. **Convert your React Component**:

   ```javascript

3. **Use the Web Component in HTML**:

   ```html
